<br/>These are the zetas you are missing from important toons (e.g. not Farmboy) that you have at G8 or higher and are sorted by popularity among people who have the character geared.  The first one is popularity within the BRG Alliance.  Higher scores are better zetas, at least in theory -- this does <b>not</b> consider your team makeup aside from a few simple rules on leadership zetas.  These are merely guidelines.<table id="zetas"><thead><tr><th>Toon</th><th>Stats</th><th>Zeta</th><th>Description</th><th title="Popularity among players">Popularity</th></tr></thead>
