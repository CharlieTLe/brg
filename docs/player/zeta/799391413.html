<br/>These are the zetas you are missing from important toons (e.g. not Farmboy) that you have at G8 or higher and are sorted by popularity among people who have the character geared.  The first one is popularity within the BRG Alliance.  Higher scores are better zetas, at least in theory -- this does <b>not</b> consider your team makeup aside from a few simple rules on leadership zetas.  These are merely guidelines.<table id="zetas"><thead><tr><th>Toon</th><th>Stats</th><th>Zeta</th><th>Description</th><th title="Popularity among players">Popularity</th></tr></thead>

At the start of battle, Rebel allies and Sana gain Protection Up (100%) until they use an ability.<br/><br/>Whenever a Rebel ally or Sana has less than 100% Turn Meter and gains bonus Turn Meter, they gain 25% Critical Damage (stacking) until they critically hit an enemy. If a Rebel Scoundrel removes Turn Meter from an enemy, that enemy also takes damage equal to 20% of their Max Health, which can't be evaded. This damage can't defeat enemies. The first time each turn Rebel allies or Sana deal damage more than once, they gain 25% Max Health (stacking, max 200%) for the rest of the encounter. Whenever Rebel allies or Sana critically hit an enemy, they inflict Target Lock for 1 turn, which can't be evaded. Whenever an enemy is inflicted with Target Lock, reduce Rebel Scoundrel Tanks' cooldowns by 1.<br/><br/><b>Special:</b> While in Territory Wars: Rebel Scoundrels and Sana are immune to Daze. At the start of battle, Rebel Scoundrel Tanks Taunt for 1 turn and Rebel Scoundrels and Sana start with Tenacity Up for 1 turn. Target Lock can't be resisted from this ability. The first time each turn Rebel allies and Sana deal damage more than once, dispel all buffs on all enemies and inflict Healing Immunity for 1 turn.</td><td>19</td></tr>
